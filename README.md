# VBA-challenge

I have prepared a .vbs file (which runs for the alphabetical testing analysis, and the other for Multiple Year Stock Data analysis), called Multiple_Years_stock_data_scrypt.vbs.  This VBA script creates a macro called Required_output_Headers_All_Columns(), which performs the Requirements of the Module challenge, namely, Retrieval of Data, Column Creation, Conditional Formatting, Calculated Values, Looping Across Worksheet. This VBA script runs all sheets successfully. 

Screenshots of the results are pasted in a Word file ("Mod_2_challenge_screenshots"), as well as, pasted below (for Multiple_Years_stock_data years):

The VBA script file and the screenshots' word file are being uploaded to GitHub.
